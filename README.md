The dashboard predicts which factories have emitted which pollutants by:

1) Enabling users to filter data points by sensor and chemical
2) Sensors and factories are positioned to scale
3) Data points radially around each sensor:
  i. Distance from the centre represents intensity of reading
  ii. Degree / angle of data point represents where the wind was blowing from
4) Data points are coloured by chemical to better spot trends
5) Calendar heatmaps enable user to identify trends and interrogate summarised data
