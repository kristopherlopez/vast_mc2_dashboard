# Vast MC2 Dashboard

http://www.vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2017+MC2

The dashboard predicts which factories have emitted which pollutants. Features of the dashboard include:

1) Enabling users to filter data points by sensor and chemical
2) Sensors and factories are positioned to scale
3) Data points radially around each sensor
4) Distance from the centre represents intensity of reading
5) Degree / angle of data point represents where the wind was blowing from
6) Data points are coloured by chemical to better spot trends
7) Calendar heatmaps enable user to identify trends and interrogate summarised data
8) Data cards appear as the user interacts to provide detail about highlighted data
